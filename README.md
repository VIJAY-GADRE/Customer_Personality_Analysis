### Interpretation 1.2
- There has not been an overwhelming response to the campaigns so far except (campaign 1). Very few participants overall
- Moreover, no one took part in all 5 of them. Perphaps, better-targets and well-planned campaigns are required to boost sales.

### Interpretation 1.3
- Unlike campaigns, the deals offered did well. It has best outcome with cluster 2 and 3.
- However, our star customers, cluster 0, are not much into the deals. Nothing seems to attract cluster 1 overwhelmingly.
